# Spotify Sonic Hub

A Python project that integrates with Spotify's API to search and retrieve tracks, albums, and artists from Spotify's vast database. The project utilizes the `spotipy` library for connecting with the Spotify Web API, allowing users to search for music and listen to it directly from the console.

## Features

- Search for tracks by title
- Search for albums by title
- Search for artists by name
- Retrieve and list all cached tracks, albums, and artists
- Uses Spotify API for in-depth searches
- Cross-pollination logic to link tracks, albums, and artists
- Easy-to-use console interface for interacting with the data

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to have the following:

1. **Python 3.x** - Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. **Spotify Developer Account** - You need a Spotify Developer account to get your `client_id` and `client_secret`.
3. **Spotipy Library** - This project uses the `spotipy` library for interacting with Spotify's Web API. You can install it with pip:
    ```bash
    pip install spotipy
    ```

## How to Set Up a Spotify Developer Account and Get Your `client_id` and `client_secret`

To interact with the Spotify API, you'll need to create a Spotify Developer account and generate a `client_id` and `client_secret`. Here's how you can do that:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Create a Spotify Developer Account**:
   - Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
   - Log in with your existing Spotify account, or create a new one.
   - Once logged in, you'll be redirected to the dashboard where you can create a new Spotify application.

2. **Create an Application**:
   - Click the "Create an App" button.
   - Fill in the necessary details for your application. You can name it whatever you like (e.g., "Spotify Sonic Hub").
   - Accept the terms and conditions, then click "Create".

3. **Get Your `client_id` and `client_secret`**:
   - After creating your app, you’ll be taken to the app’s settings page.
   - Here, you will find your `client_id` and `client_secret`. You’ll use these to authenticate your app when interacting with the Spotify API.

4. **Keep Your Credentials Safe**:
   - Treat your `client_id` and `client_secret` like a password. Do not expose them in public repositories.

### Integrating Your Spotify Credentials with the Project

1. Open the `spotify_sonic_hub.py` file.
2. Find the section where it asks for `client_id` and `client_secret`:
    ```python
    client_id = None
    client_secret = None
    ```
3. Replace the `None` values with the `client_id` and `client_secret` you obtained from the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
    ```python
    client_id = "your_client_id_here"
    client_secret = "your_client_secret_here"
    ```
    (Or enter your Client ID and Secret instead of integrating it into your code when you run the program)

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-sonic-hub.git
    cd spotify-sonic-hub
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the project:
    ```bash
    python spotify_sonic_hub.py
    ```

4. The program will prompt you to enter your `client_id` and `client_secret` (if you haven't set them directly in the code). You can then search for tracks, albums, and artists from the console interface.

## How It Works

- **Spotify API**: The project communicates with the Spotify API using the `spotipy` library, which allows access to Spotify's vast music database.
- **Search Capabilities**: You can search for albums, tracks, and artists directly from the console interface.
- **Cross-Pollination**: The program maintains relationships between tracks, albums, and artists and can automatically add them to the correct categories when they're found.
- **Caching**: Once data is retrieved from the Spotify API, it is stored in memory (cached) to avoid multiple API requests for the same data.
